# Save the Children Icon Font

This project aims to create a standard icon font for Save the Children, using easily scalable vector graphics.

## Getting Started

Copy the fonts and CSS directory into your project. In the <head> of your HTML, reference the location to your stc-icons.css.

You can then use the icon classes in your HTML code:

<i class="fstc fstc-circle"></i>

You can view the list of available icons by opening the index.html file.
